# **Human Activities and Postural Transitions (HAPT) Classification using Deep Learning**


In this project, a multivariate time-series dataset from UCI was used for classification of Human Acitivies and Postural Transitions. More information about this dataset can be found here:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/341/smartphone+based+recognition+of+human+activities+and+postural+transitions

The data contains accelerometer and gyroscope data from 30 users for 12 different activities and posture transitions. RNN based deep learning archiectures GRU and LSTM were trained on this data with 90% test accuracy on unseen data.
